    <h1>One Week by Barenaked Ladies</h1>
    <hr>

    <p>
        It's been one week since you looked at me<br>
        Cocked your head to the side and said, "I'm angry"<br>
        Five days since you laughed at me<br>
        Saying, "Get that together, come back and see me"<br>
        Three days since the living room<br>
        I realized it's all my fault, but couldn't tell you<br>
        Yesterday, you'd forgiven me<br>
        But it'll still be two days 'til I say I'm sorry
     </p>
     <p>
        Hold it now and watch the hoodwink<br>
        As I make you stop, think<br>
        You'll think you're looking at Aquaman<br>
        I summon fish to the dish, although I like the <a href="http://www.swisschalet.com/">Chalet Swiss</a><br>
        I like the sushi 'cause it's never touched a frying pan<br>
        Hot like wasabi when I bust rhymes<br>
        Big like LeAnn Rimes, because I'm all about value<br>
        Bert Kaempfert's got the mad hits<br>
        You try to match wits, you try to hold me but I bust through<br>
        Gonna make a break and take a fake<br>
        I'd like a stinking aching shake<br>
        I like vanilla, it's the finest of the flavors<br>
        Gotta see the show, 'cause then you'll know<br>
        The vertigo is gonna grow<br>
        'Cause it's so dangerous, you'll have to sign a waiver
     </p>
     <p>
        How can I help it if I think you're funny when you're mad?<br>
        Trying hard not to smile, though I feel bad<br>
        I'm the kind of guy who laughs at a funeral<br>
        Can't understand what I mean? Well, you soon will<br>
        I have a tendency to wear my mind on my sleeve<br>
        I have a history of taking off my shirt
     </p>
     <p><strong>
        It's been one week since you looked at me<br>
        Threw your arms in the air and said, "You're crazy"<br>
        Five days since you tackled me<br>
        I've still got the rug burns on both my knees<br>
        It's been three days since the afternoon<br>
        You realized it's not my fault not a moment too soon<br>
        Yesterday, you'd forgiven me<br>
        And now I sit back and wait 'til you say you're sorry
     </strong></p>
     <p>
        Chickity China, the Chinese chicken<br>
        You have a drumstick and your brain stops tickin'<br>
        Watchin' <i>X-Files</i> with no lights on,<br>
        We're dans la maison<br>
      I hope the Smoking Man's in this one<br>
      Like Harrison Ford, I'm getting frantic<br>
      Like Sting, I'm tantric<br>
      Like Snickers, guaranteed to satisfy<br>
      Like Kurosawa, I make mad films<br>
      'Kay, I don't make films, but if I did they'd have a samurai<br>
      Gonna get a set of better clubs<br>
      Gonna find the kind with tiny nubs<br>
      Just so my irons aren't always flying off the back-swing<br>
      Gotta get in tune with <a href="http://www.viz.com/sailor-moon"><i>Sailor Moon</i></a><br>
      'Cause that cartoon has got the boom anime babes<br>
      That make me think the wrong thing
   </p>
   <p>
    How can I help it if I think you're funny when you're mad?<br>
    Trying hard not to smile, though I feel bad<br>
    I'm the kind of guy who laughs at a funeral<br>
    Can't understand what I mean? You soon will<br>
    I have a tendency to wear my mind on my sleeve<br>
    I have a history of losing my shirt

    "You just did just what I thought you were gonna do"<br>
    Three days since the living room<br>
    We realized we're both to blame but what could we do?<br>
    Yesterday, you just smiled at me<br>

    It'll still be two days 'til we say we're sorry<br>
    It'll still be two days 'til we say, "Wasabi"<br>
